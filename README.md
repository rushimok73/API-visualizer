# Cateina API visualizer

The Cateina API graph generator will generate a tree diagram with each node as a separate data entity connected to other data entities connected to each other via links.

The nodes display attributes namely the name, the type of node as an image and are connected to each other via links according to their tree-based hierarchy.

The links display the type of connection between two nodes.

Use commands "npm install" "npm start" first

After the project opens click on "start" Button for the graph to display.
